 # Iris Data Analysis with Quarto

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates an analysis of the `iris` dataset using **Quarto** for document rendering. The aim of this assignment was to explore the sepal and petal measurements of different iris species and visualize the relationships between these variables. This project also introduces the basics of working with **Quarto**, including generating both HTML and PDF outputs. 

## Implementation
The analysis involves:
1. Loading required libraries, specifically `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization.
2. Utilizing the `iris` dataset, which includes measurements for sepal and petal lengths and widths across three iris species.
3. Generating a scatter plot using `ggplot2` to visualize the relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width for each species.

`code`
labs(
    title = "Scatter plot of Sepal Length and Width",
    x = "Sepal Length (cm)", y = "Sepal Width (mm)",
    color = "Iris species", shape = "Iris species"
  )
